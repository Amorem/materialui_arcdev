              Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College,
              is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous
              filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was
              piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word.
              Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De
              Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a
              first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.

              Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born
              as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and
              it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a
              curious reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency
              with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it
              looks pretty real.”

                The decade that brought us Star Trek and Doctor Who also

                And that’s why a 15th century typesetter might have scrambled a
                passage of Cicero; he wanted people to focus on his fonts, to
                imagine their own content on the pages. He wanted people to see,
                and to get them to see he had to keep them from reading.
